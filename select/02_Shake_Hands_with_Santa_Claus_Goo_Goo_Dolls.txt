If you want some candy, I'll bring you the candy
Shake hands with Santa Claus
I love you, I love you and I'm going to bring
Some candy and flowers and everything

If berries are pleasing when they're out of season
Shake hands with Santa Claus
I love you, I love you and I'd walk a mile
To bring you the berries and watch you smile

Oh just to share a love like yours
What miracles I could do
I'd make a rainbow chase a storm
The weather gets cold I'll make it warm

If you want a cottage, I'll furnish the cottage
Shake hands with Santa Claus
I love you, I love you I give you my all
I'm like the genie at your beck and call
If you do the dreaming, I'll do the scheming
Shake hands with Santa Claus

Oh just to win a love like yours
I'd follow you to Capri
I'd kiss you on the streets of Rome
Then we'd eat scungilli then fly back home
If you want bananas, some great big bananas
Shake hands with Santa Claus
I love you, I love you and I'm gonna bring
Bananas, pianos and everything
If you do the dreaming, I'll do the scheming
Shake hands shake hands shake hands
With Santa Claus
Santa Claus
Santa Claus
Santa Claus

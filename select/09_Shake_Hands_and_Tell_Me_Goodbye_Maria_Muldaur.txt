I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye
I don't want you no more sweet baby, didn't love me nohow
Last night, night before, I saw another man knocking on your door
I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye

I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye
I don't want you no more sweet baby, you didn't love me nohow
I worked all the winter, winter was tough (weather was tough?)
With another man just a-strutting your stuff
I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye

I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye
I'm leaving this town tomorrow, no use to sorrow (sob?) and cry
I was good when you was sick, and good when you was well
'No use to pray when you get in hell
I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye

I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye
I ain't got you
Still you pass me by
I worked all the winter, In the chilly wind
You giving your loving to the other men
I don't want you no more sweet baby, shake hands and tell your daddy goodbye

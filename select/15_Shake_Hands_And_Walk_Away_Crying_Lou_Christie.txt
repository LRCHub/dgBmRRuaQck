Rumors gettin' 'round, my sweet baby put me down
Ain't a girl alive with the suffering I feel inside
Mine's not a peppering fool
& When you go with me you play by my rules
If that's the way she wants to play, then I'll forget her
She's thinkin' how she'll beat me to the punch, but I won't let her

CHORUS:
Shake hands & walk away (& look at him cryin')
Come on, come on, come on, come on
I'm gonna shake hands & walk away (& look at him cryin')
Come on, come on, come on, come on now

I'll never say to you, breakin' up is hard to do
'Cause I've got my pride; a big man never cries
There's much of life in you, & you'd better run too
Knowing it's our last goodbye, it's hard to face you
Don't expect me back for more, I'll just erase you

(Chorus)
(Instrumental)
(Chorus)

Shake hands & walk away (ring of echo chamber)
There's much of life in you, & you'd better run too

(Repeat chorus & fade
